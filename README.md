**This is just minimal idea test.**

You can write a simple unity project like [codepen](https://codepen.io/about/)

I have some plan below. (TODO LIST)
- Purets WebGL Intergration
- Virtual File System 
- Better Runtime Code Editor With SyntaxHighlight


Unfortunately, currently I'm not very familiar with WebGL and I have a lot of problems to solve ðŸ˜±



[Runtime Hierarchy Inspector](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityRuntimeInspector) - Unity Runtine Hierarchy System.   
[SharpFileSystem](https://github.com/bobvanderlinden/sharpfilesystem) - C# Virtual File System   
[Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint), [Espria](https://github.com/sebastienros/esprima-dotnet) - Javascript Compiler & AST
